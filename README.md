## About me

I'm a software engineer most known for my work on [Teloxide] and [Metalang99].

My interests range over systems programming, backend engineering, compilers, type theory, functional programming, and program transformations.

In my free time, I enjoy publishing posts on [my personal blog] and implementing various [things from research papers].

I use C, OCaml, Rust, and Golang for everyday programming.
